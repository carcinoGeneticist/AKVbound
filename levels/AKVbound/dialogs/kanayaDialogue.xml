			 @kanaya_happytalk KANAYA: Hello Karkat How Rare Of You To Join The Living
			 @karkat_talk KARKAT: WHAT LIVING? WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE. AREN'T YOU DEAD?
			 @kanaya_bored KANAYA: Could You Just Please Let My Use These Sayings I Have Learned At Least Once
			 @karkat_eyeroll1 KARKAT: NO, BECAUSE THEY'RE DUMB AND I DON'T LIKE THEM.
			 @kanaya_bored KANAYA: Fine Have It Your Way
			 @kanaya_talk KANAYA: Is There Something You Needed From The Common Area 
			 @karkat_what KARKAT: NO... WHAT, AM I BOTHERING YOU?
			 @kanaya_talk KANAYA: Of Course Not
			 @kanaya_talk KANAYA: I Was Planning On Doing A Bit More Research With Rose But Dave Wanted To Show Her Something So Now I Am Just Waiting Until She Returns
			 @kanaya_happytalk KANAYA: If We Were Busy I Would Let You Stay Anyway As Long As You Used Your Inside Voice
			 @karkat_talk KARKAT: RIGHT. SURE.
			 @kanaya_bored KANAYA: Inside Voice Karkat
			 @karkat_eyeroll2 KARKAT: ...

			 KARKAT: HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING NEW SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS BRIEFED ON ALL THIS SHIT? IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU TWO PRETTY MUCH HAD EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT THEN.
			 KANAYA: We Do Have A Good General Idea But There Are Always Gaps To Fill In
			 KANAYA: The More We Look Through All Of This The More Chances There Are We Will Find Something Ground Breaking
			 KANAYA: We Are Learning More About The Challenges That Await Us Bit By Bit And It Means We Will Be More Prepared When We Arrive In The New Session In A Sweeps Time
			 KANAYA: Though Sometimes We Just Look Through Some Of The Books You Brought Back
			 KARKAT: WAIT. WHAT EXACTLY THE FUCK IS THERE TO STUDY FROM THOSE?
			 KANAYA: Not Much That Relates To What I Just Saying But Rose Finds That They Illustrate Many Points Aspects Of Troll Culture Quite Colorfully
			 KANAYA: That Last Part Was A Double Entendre
			 KANAYA: Some Of Them Are Quite Raunchy
			 KANAYA: I Would Say I Never Expected You To Be Interested In That Sort Of Literature But That Would Be Lying
			 KARKAT: DON'T YOU FUCKING JUDGE ME. AT LEAST I WASN'T INTO THOSE FUCK FORSAKEN RAINBOW DRINKER ROMANCE NOVELS FOR WIGGLER SISSIES THAT WET THEIR UNDERGARMENTS.
			 KANAYA: My Tastes Have Matured Since Then Karkat
			 KANAYA: I Am Not Going To Judge You Either Quite Honestly I Believe We Could Have Intriguing Book Discussions If You Were At All Interested
			 KANAYA: It Would Be Refreshing To Talk About These Sort Of Things In A Non Educational Sense
			 KARKAT: I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

			 KARKAT: I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT SOMETHING.
			 KANAYA: What Is It
			 KARKAT: ARE THERE ANY PERKS TO BEING A RAINBOW DRINKER? LIKE ARE YOU IMMORTAL NOW THAT YOU DIED ONCE? AND TECHNICALLY ARE STILL DEAD? I STILL DON'T REALLY FULLY GET THAT WHOLE THING.
			 KANAYA: I Would Try To Explain How It Works But It Basically Boils Down To Strange Magic And I Sometimes Feel Like The Rules That Govern It May As Well Just Be Arbitrarily Random And There Is Not Much I Think You Would Understand Easily
			 KARKAT: OK... THEN MAYBE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK I WOULD UNDERSTAND AT LEAST?
			 KANAYA: Well I Drink Blood Now
			 KARKAT: OF FUCKING COURSE, I KNEW THAT MUCH.
			 KANAYA: That Is About All You Would Be Able To Understand
