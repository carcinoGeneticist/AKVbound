                                        @dave_talk DAVE: but it kept replaying itself in my head and i dont want to go back outside and look or tell anyone else because i wasnt even sure if it was just my head or not
                                        @dave_concern DAVE: so either im hallucinating that i heard all of my friends get shattered far away in space or i really did hear everyone screaming in anguish from far away in space and i dont know what i want the answer to that question to be
